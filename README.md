# Cloud Computing Week 5
# Homework 4
# Create TSV Script

## Overview
This project includes a Python script that generates a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file containing information about files in a specified directory. The TSV file includes the URL, file size, and MD5 checksum of each file. This is particularly useful for transferring data to a cloud storage service.

## Homework Assignment
This project is part of a homework assignment for the Cloud Computing course. The goal is to practice Python scripting, data handling, and cloud storage concepts.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and implement file handling in Python.
- Learn how to calculate file sizes and generate MD5 checksums.
- Gain experience with creating and writing to TSV files.
- Familiarize with basic cloud storage operations and data transfer procedures.

## Files
- `make_tsv.py`: The main Python script that generates the TSV file.
- `books.tsv`: The output TSV file generated by the script (if already run).

## Directory Structure
Make sure your directory structure looks like this:

Cloud Computing/

├── make_tsv.py

├── books/

│ ├── example1.txt

│ ├── example2.txt

│ └── ...

├── books.tsv (generated by the script)


## How to Use
1. **Prepare Your Environment**
    - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    - Place the files you want to include in the TSV inside the `books` directory.

2. **Run the Script**
    - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `make_tsv.py`.
    - Run the script with the command:
      ```sh
      python make_tsv.py
      ```

3. **Output**
    - The script will generate a file named `books.tsv` in the same directory.
    - The `books.tsv` file will contain information about each file in the `books` directory, formatted as TSV.

## How It Works
- **Constants:**
  - `PREFIX`: The base URL where the files are supposed to be hosted.
  - `BK_DIR`: The directory containing the files (`./books/`).

- **Functions:**
  - `get_file_size(file_path)`: Returns the size of the file in bytes.
  - `get_md5(file_path)`: Returns the MD5 checksum of the file in base64 encoding.
  - `create_tsv()`: Creates the `books.tsv` file with the required information.

- **Process:**
  1. The script lists all files in the `books` directory.
  2. For each file, it calculates the file size and MD5 checksum.
  3. It writes the URL, file size, and MD5 checksum to `books.tsv` in TSV format.

## Example
Here is an example of what the `books.tsv` file might look like:

TsvHttpData-1.0

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cd-public/books/main/example2.txt 67890 efgh5678==


## Notes
- Ensure the `books` directory exists and contains the files you want to process.
- The script must be run in the same directory as `make_tsv.py` for the paths to work correctly.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter a `FileNotFoundError`, ensure the `BK_DIR` path is correct and the directory exists.
- Ensure all required Python libraries (`os`, `hashlib`, `base64`) are available.
